# Question 1

## Part A
 
```{r echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(moderndive))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mosaic))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))


solder <- read.csv("solder.csv")
solder$solder1<- ifelse(solder$Solder=="Thick", 1, 0)
solder$Opening1[solder$Opening == 'L']=2
solder$Opening1[solder$Opening == 'M']=1
solder$Opening1[solder$Opening == 'S']=0

ggplot(solder, aes(x = Opening1, y = skips)) + geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method= lm)+
  labs(title = "Size of Opening vs Number of Skips")



```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(solder, aes(x = solder1, y = skips)) +geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method= lm)+
  labs(title = "Type of Solder vs Number of Skips")

```



## Part B

```{r echo=FALSE}
# model2= do(10000)*lm(skips ~ Opening1+ solder1+ Opening1:solder1, data=resample(solder))
# confint(model2,level= .95)
model1 = lm(skips ~ Opening1+ solder1+ Opening1:solder1, data=resample(solder))
get_regression_table(model1)
# lm(skips ~ Opening1, solder1, Opening1:solder1, data=solder)
```

## Part C

Intercept = 16.049: Baseline when number of skips
 and Solder are 0. 
					
Opening = -7.615: The change in number of skips when the opening increases a by size
					
Solder = -10.594: The change in number of skips when the alloy thickness increases from think to thick
					
Opening.Solder = 4.908: This is the change in number of skips when both
 the opening size and solder changes.
 
 


## Part D

 It is better to have a large opening and use a thick Solder, because a larger opening has lower amount of skips and a thicker sodler has a lower amount of skips. 


# Question 2

## Part A

```{r echo=FALSE}
groceries <- read.csv("groceries.csv")
groceries_sum = groceries%>%group_by(Store)%>% summarize(avg_price= mean(Price))
ggplot(groceries_sum, aes(x=Store, y = avg_price))+geom_bar(stat= "identity")+coord_flip() + labs(Title ="Average Grocery Prices of Different Stores", y= "Average Prices", x = "Store")
```

## Part B

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
# groceries <- groceries %>%
#   mutate(Store = case_when(
#     Store == "H-E-B" & Neighborhood == "Hancock" ~ "HEB1",
#     Store == "H-E-B" & Neighborhood == "Downtown" ~ "HEB2",
#     Store == "Whole Foods" & Neighborhood == "Hancock" ~ "WholeFoods1",
#     Store == "Whole Foods" & Neighborhood == "Downtown" ~ "WholeFoods2",
#     TRUE ~ Store
#   ))
groceries<-groceries %>% mutate(StoreUnique = paste(Store, Neighborhood, sep = "-"))

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
groceries<-groceries %>% mutate(StoreUnique = paste(Store, Neighborhood, sep = "-"))

groceries_sum1 = groceries%>%group_by(Product)%>% summarize(product_amount =n_distinct(StoreUnique))

ggplot(groceries_sum1, aes(x=Product, y = product_amount))+geom_bar(stat= "identity")+coord_flip() + labs(Title ="Amount of Product", y= "Product Amount", x = "Product")+ylim(0,16)
```


## Part C

```{r echo=FALSE}
# groceries$Type <- relevel(groceries$Type, ref = "Grocery")
# grocery_model<- lm
groceries$Type <- factor(groceries$Type)
groceries$Type <- relevel(groceries$Type, ref = "Grocery")

groceries_lm <- lm(Price ~ Product + Type, data=groceries)
get_regression_table(groceries_lm, conf.level = 0.95, digits=2)

```

Compared with ordinary grocery stores (like Albertsons, HEB, or Krogers), convenience stores charge somewhere between
.41 and .92 dollars more for the same product.” 

## Part D

```{r echo=FALSE}
# groceries$Price <- factor(groceries$Price)
# groceries$Price <- relevel(groceries$Price, ref = "Grocery")
groceries_lm1 <- lm(Price ~ StoreUnique + Product, data=groceries)

get_regression_table(groceries_lm1, conf.level = 0.95, digits=2)

```

## Part E
```{r echo=FALSE}
groceries$Store <- as.factor(groceries$Store)
groceries$Store <- relevel(groceries$Store, ref = "H-E-B ")
groceries_model2 <- lm(Price ~ Store + Product, data=groceries)
get_regression_table(groceries_model2, conf.level = 0.95, digits=2)

```

## Part F

```{r echo=FALSE}
groceries <- groceries %>%
  mutate(Income10K = Income / 10000)
model_income <- lm(Price ~ Product + Income10K, data = groceries)
get_regression_table(model_income)

```

# Question 3

## Part A 

True because in the model A1, there is a positive correlation between Minority percentage and FAIR policies. The model has a 95% confidence interval and gave us a low p- value of 0 and an estimate (slope) between .009  to .018. The r^2 is also relatively high at around .516. This means that for every 1 percent increase in minority percentage, there is an increase of .009 and .018 FAIR policies per 100 houses.

## Part B

False, model B1 shows us a weak relationship between age and minority percentage. The estimate (slope) is .398, p value is .125 which is higher than the conventionally used .05, and the r^2 is very low at .05. This suggest there is no interaction between age and minority percentage affecting FAIR policies.

## Part C

True, in the model C1, the high fire risk group has a estimate of .01 with a p-value of .15 while the low fire risk group has an estimate of -.001 and a p value of .839. This would suggest that the high risk group has a stronger relationship between minority percentage and Fair Policies than the group with low risk since the high risk group has a p value of .015 which is lower than the conventionally used p value while the low risk has a p value of .938 which is higher than the .05.

## Part D

False, in model D2, the estimate for minority percentage is .01 and the p -value is .002. Income has a estimate as -.074 and a p value as .041. This means that income explains some of the correlation but not ALL of the correlation between minority percentage and FAIR policies.

## Part E

True, In model E, it shows that they have an relationship as the estimate is .008 and the p value is .006 which is lower than .05 meaning that it is statistically signifigant.
